# Create issues
Use the code! Play with it, give us feedback. You can always create an issue to let us know what is wrong or you think needs to be changed.

# Solve issues
Pick an issue from github. Tell us that you're working on it, create a draft PR (so we can discuss if all is going in the right direction), finish off and make the PR.
